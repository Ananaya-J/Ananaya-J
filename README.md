## 🌟 The Intersection of Biology and Code

<img align="right" alt="Coding DNA" width="300" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/LaVp0AyqR5bGsC5Cbm/giphy.gif">

I exist at the fascinating crossroads where **molecular biology meets artificial intelligence**, where protein folding patterns become machine learning features, and where genomic variants tell stories of human evolution and disease. 

My work revolves around a simple yet profound belief: 

> **🎯 Every biological system is a computational problem waiting to be solved**

## 🧠 My Philosophical Approach

```

</div>

Biology is fundamentally **information processing at the molecular level**. DNA serves as storage, RNA as messaging, and proteins as the executive processors. I approach biological research as a systems engineer would approach a complex distributed computing network.

<details>
<summary>🔍 <strong>What drives my research</strong></summary>

- 🎯 The conviction that "undruggable" proteins are simply targets we haven't learned to speak to yet
- 🧬 The belief that precision medicine should be as personalized as a fingerprint  
- ⚡ The understanding that molecular dynamics simulations are windows into biological reality
- 🚀 The vision that AI can accelerate drug discovery from decades to years

## 🎨 The Art of Molecular Engineering

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### 🔑 Molecular Architecture
I see molecular docking not just as computational chemistry, but as **molecular architecture**—designing keys for locks we're still learning to understand.

</td>
<td width="50%">

### 🕸️ Knowledge Graphs
I build digital ecosystems where genes, proteins, metabolites, and phenotypes can communicate across traditional research silos.

## ⚡ Computational Philosophy

<img align="left" alt="HPC Computing" width="250" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3oKIPEqDGUULpEU0aQ/giphy.gif">

### 🚀 **HPC as Biological Time Travel**
Using **ADA supercomputing infrastructure** and **AWS cloud platforms**, I can simulate microseconds of protein motion that would take months to observe experimentally. This isn't just computation—it's temporal archaeology.

### 🧠 **ML as Pattern Recognition in Life**
Every algorithm I develop is an attempt to teach computers to recognize the patterns that evolution has been writing for billions of years.

## 🎭 Research Aesthetic

<details>
<summary>🧬 <strong>Precision Medicine as Personalized Computation</strong></summary>

Every individual's genome is a unique algorithm. My pharmacogenomics work treats drug response prediction as personalized software optimization—finding the right therapeutic parameters for each individual's biological operating system.

</details>

<details>
<summary>🎬 <strong>Structural Biology as Molecular Cinema</strong></summary>

Protein structures aren't static sculptures; they're dynamic performances. Through molecular dynamics simulations, I direct molecular movies, watching how proteins breathe, flex, and dance with their ligand partners.

</details>

<details>
<summary>🐛 <strong>Genomics as Evolutionary Debugging</strong></summary>

Disease-causing mutations are essentially bugs in the human genetic code. My variant analysis work involves debugging these biological programs, understanding how single nucleotide changes can crash entire physiological systems.

## 🧘 Technical Meditation

<img align="right" alt="Coding Meditation" width="200" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/ZVik7pBtu9dNS/giphy.gif">

Programming, for me, is a form of **scientific meditation**. Whether I'm writing Python scripts or developing React applications, coding becomes a dialogue with biological complexity.

### 🗣️ Speaking Biology's Languages:
- **🐍 Python** → Data wrangling
- **📊 R** → Statistical analysis  
- **🗃️ SQL** → Relationship queries
- **⚡ Bash** → Workflow orchestration

## 📜 Personal Research Manifesto

<div align="center">
<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/🔬-Research%20Philosophy-blueviolet?style=for-the-badge">
</div>

I believe that the most profound scientific discoveries happen at **interfaces**—between disciplines, between scales, between the digital and biological worlds. My research exists in these liminal spaces, translating molecular language into computational insights and back again.

<div align="center">

```

</div>

Every protein I dock, every genome I analyze, every model I train is part of a larger project: **teaching computers to understand life**, and using that understanding to improve human health.

<div align="center">

## 🎯 Current Focus

**Building the computational infrastructure for the next generation of biological discovery**

*Where artificial intelligence and human intuition collaborate to decode the fundamental algorithms of life*

<br>

🌍 **Location:** India  
🤝 **Status:** Open to collaborative research opportunities worldwide
